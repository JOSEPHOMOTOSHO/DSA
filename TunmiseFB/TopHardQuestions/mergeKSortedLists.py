Approach 1: Brute Force
Intuition & Algorithm

Traverse all the linked lists and collect the values of the nodes into an array.
Sort and iterate over this array to get the proper value of nodes.
Create a new sorted linked list and extend it with the new nodes.


Time complexity : O(NlogN) where NN is the total number of nodes.

                    Collecting all the values costs O(N) time.
                    A stable sorting algorithm costs O(NlogN) time.
                    Iterating for creating the linked list costs O(N) time.

Space complexity : O(N).

                    Sorting cost O(N) space (depends on the algorithm you choose).
                    Creating a new linked list costs O(N) space

APPROACH 2: USING HEAP/PRIORITY QUEUE

Algorithm

Compare every k nodes (head of every linked list) and get the node with the smallest value.
Extend the final sorted linked list with the selected nodes.



Example:

1 -> 3 -> 5
1 -> 4
1 -> 3 -> 6 -> 8

we sort our minheap using the root value of each independent linkedlist, cos the root is the smallest in the LL

minHeap = [1 -> 3 -> 5, 1 -> 4, 1 -> 3 -> 6 -> 8]

to build our LL result, we need to know what .next to add. So we pop the first thing in our minHeap, which is 
1 -> 3 -> 5.

so we just take the root and push it remaining back into the mean heap, which will automatically just resort it self.

so we just pop and ppend to our tail ad continue like that

N - cmbined length of all the lists.

Time complexity : O(Nlogk) where k is the number of linked lists.

                The comparison cost will be reduced to O(logk) for every pop and insertion to priority queue. But finding the node with the smallest value just costs O(1) time.
                There are N nodes in the final linked list.

Space complexity :

                O(n) Creating a new linked list costs O(n)O(n) space.

                heap is O(k) cos the list wil always have k items The code above present applies in-place method which cost O(1) space
