We can traverse using BFS or DFS.

Algorithm

Standard inorder recursion follows left -> node -> right order, where left and right parts are the recursion calls and node part is where all processing is done.

Processing here is basically to link the previous node with the current one, and because of that one has to track the last node which is the largest node in a new doubly linked list so far.

One more detail : one has to keep the first, or the smallest, node as well to close the ring of doubly linked list.

Here is the algorithm :

1. Initiate the first and the last nodes as nulls.

2. Call the standard inorder recursion helper(root) :

    If node is not null :

        Call the recursion for the left subtree helper(node.left).

        If the last node is not null, link the last and the current node nodes.

        Else initiate the first node.

        Mark the current node as the last one : last = node.

        Call the recursion for the right subtree helper(node.right).

3. Link the first and the last nodes to close DLL ring and then return the first node.

Time complexity - O(N) since each node is processed exactly once.

Space complexity - O(N). We have to keep a recursion stack of the O(N) for the worst case of completely unbalanced tree.

MORRIS TRAVERSAL WITH O(1) SPACE 

Morris traversal should be O(1) extra space. You cant count the solution set as extra space since that was what was asked in the first place.
The whole point of Morris traversal is to eliminate the need for extra space(either call stack or stack in interative method).
No point of doing all that extra work of modifying all the nodes for no gain in time or space complexity.


Pseudo Code
1. Initialize current as root 
2. While current is not NULL
   If current hs a left child
      ifa) Make current as right child of the rightmost 
         node in current's left subtree
      ifb) Go to this left child, i.e., current = current->left
   Else
      ea) Print currentâ€™s data
      eb) Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right
